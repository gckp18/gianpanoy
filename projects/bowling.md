# Ready to Strike

I started bowling in my freshman year of high school. I had a late start, missing that year's tryouts, but I knew I wanted to keep going. I was in the local junior bowling league where weekly I could get outside help. Every practice was a focus on just growing in any aspect of my game. I also became a Captain of my team at one point. I was able to take a team as a leader in a tournment wiht other junior bowlers. That experience was unqiue because I put into a leadership position I had no experience in leading a group of athletes so it was interesting.

# High School Memories

In my last high school season, we won and could represent the Island of Kauai and travel to the neighboring Island of Oahu to compete in state tournament. Those are some of the moments from high school I cheerish the most. Through sports and team collaboration, it fosters growth in everyone through forming deep connections with others but also working towards goals. Something that stuck with me, is that many people's high school's career will be their peak of that kind of competition. It is so unique not all of us get to play in University so I look back at my high school games proud.

# Very Far From Home

One of the best experiences of my life has been going up to Michigan to play in a tournament called Junior Gold. It was a nationwide event where the winner of the tournament had the chance to be on the youth national team. I got to meet a lot of competitive juniors and professional bowlers around the Country. In the last photo, is me and PBA and USBC Hall of Fame player Norm Duke. I by no means was a professional bowler, I consider myself very lucky to have that opportunity. I prepared for months honing both mental and physical games. But what I took away the most was how to mentally stay strong. Bowling is special in a way that when you are up on the lane it is just you. There are no other distractions so the real battle is in your mind. That is a lesson I've taken with me in my life.

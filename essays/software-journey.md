# Everyone Starts Somewhere
When applying for colleges I chose computer science on a whim. Might be a "bad move" to admit that but it's true. I had a passion for STEM growing up doing engineering camps and taking up higher-level math classes in high school but I never fully focused on the cs world. Going into University with that as my major, I didn't know what to expect. What feels like my short time here at UH Manoa has been such an amazing learning experience. In past courses, I enjoyed problem-solving through code and seeing how to play with different data structures in real-life applications. I got experience in a whole new world and one in tech not bound by the term "software engineering." I got to meet new friends who have the same interests as me. Now, I see myself pursuing a career in software engineering. I still have a lot to learn but I hope through this software engineering class and taking what I learned going beyond I get to where I hope to be.

# My Code Jounrey So Far
Learning the basics of code was fascinating to me being able to communicate with a computer to have it. Being able to code, I also hope to improve my way of approaching different projects. That is a very important skill other professors have mentioned in class, is the ability to problem-solve your way through it using code as the method of communication, most of the time without even writing a single line. What I hope to learn from this software engineering class is how to use different languages or other areas of software development. However, to be able to think about the best way to solve a problem through the practice Workouts of the Day done in software engineering class. I hope to understand full-stack development, as it is a term passed around. I hope I have the tools to implement it into my applications.

# Look Towards the Future
One future project I want to potentially explore is updating this personal portfolio's themes with some of my edits to fully realize my vision. Having a custom theme and layout would help me stand out more and give me more practice. Also potentially give some of my projects a UI with Javascript. An example would be my bank records project in this portfolio. It takes input from the console, but having an interactable interface would be a nice addition to the project and also show off the skills learned from this class.

Looking forward I am very excited for what this class has to offer me in my path to becoming a software engineer. However, it is up to me to make sure I learn the content to apply it for future positions.

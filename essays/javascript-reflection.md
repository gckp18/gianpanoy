## Hold Up, Wait a Minute

Throughout my first two years of undergrad, I learned the basics of programming. With proper variable and function names, declaring your variables at the beginning of your program, and much more. These standards help develop my mind to tackle challenges and problems in languages like Java and C. And then all of a sudden, Javascript hit me with something unexpected. A variable holding an integer can also hold a string. First, this caught me off guard but then I was stuck with one question, why?

## You Made It Just-In-Time

I learned that Javascript uses the Just-in-time (JIT) compiler. That allows it to interpret code but also compile it at runtime.  But just like Java, I can assume that it also has a slower runtime due to the fact it has to interpret as the program runs. What I found interesting about Javascript's JIT compiler is that this makes sense as its primary application is websites and front-end development. I believe that Javascript is a good language for software engineering because most software and especially website/front-end development are very based on the user. Having more dynamic variables sounds like a benefit. That is because using variables for multiple different places but also having multiple different values depending on the user.

## Personal Experience

I took a programming structures class that taught C before learning Javascript. With C being a low-level language you can modify and personally allocate certain amounts of space in RAM and on the Heap. This makes it a more powerful and personal language to the programmer in terms of each little process. So far, JavaScript seems more akin to Java as both are high-level languages. However, I can make many comparisons to C due to the fact they are two different levels of programming.

From playing sports in high school like tennis and bowling, I've always looked up to athletes as a symbol of hard work and dedication. So I find myself in agreement with the athletic software approach in this class. I believe that consistency is a strong indicator of success. Working on the practice WODs with a little bit of intensity helps me focus on the question. Without urgency, it is hard to have others work towards something. There is also an aspect of athletes that is often highlighted that can be applied to here and that is mentality. Sure you can grind all the WODs and watch the videos however having a learning-based and positive mindset will take you far in class and outside of the classroom just like in sports. Many times I've applied mental concepts like grit and discipline to my personal and school life that I have gained from athletics.

Overall I am very excited to learn and implement Javascript in this course. I know I will apply concepts like Javascript outside of the course.

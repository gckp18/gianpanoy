Through my first two years of undergrad learning the basics of programming. With proper variable and function names, understanding And then Javascript hit me with something unexpected. A variable holding an integer can also hold a string. I previously had no experience with Javascript, only having experience with C and Java. Javascript is very different to both of these languages in different ways.

The side of javascript I wanted to understand is what goes on behind the scenes. And just asking the question, why? I took a programming structures class that taught C prior to learning Javascript. With C being a low-level language you are able to modify and personally allocate certain amounts of space in RAM and on the Heap. This makes it a more powerful and personal language to the programmer in terms of each little process. So far, javascript seems more akin to Java as both are high-level languages. Though I can make many comparisons to C due to the fact they are two different levels of programming. I seek the answer to my original question.

## Applications of Javascript

Javascript uses the Just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Which allows it to interpret code but also compiles it at runtime.  But just like Java I can make the assumption that it also has a slower runtime due to the fact it has to interpret as the program runs. What I found interesting about Javascript's JIT compiler is that this makes sense as its primary application is websites and front-end development. I believe that Javascript is a good language for software engineering due to the fact that most software and especially website/front-end development are very based on the user. Having more dynamic variables to me sounds like a benefit to software engineering. That is because using variables for multiple different places but also having multiple different values depending on the user.

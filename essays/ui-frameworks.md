# Customize Your Site Easy
A good way to think about UI frameworks is just CSS class prewritten for you. That is the essence of that bootstrap. So by going through the trials of investing your time and potentially frustration. It can save you time in the future just by calling on that same class over and over. This also aids in the fact of its reproducibility, you can have the same edit in just one phrase of a class call. So for example multiple pages and even in things that extend outside of the directory like other whole projects that you want a similar design to UI all you have to do is use the same classes and not rewrite the CSS functions yourself.

# My Thoughts on Bootstrap
My personal experience with Bootstrap 5 was super interesting. I have not worked with other UI frameworks just from this week's lecture on Bootstrap. I got to explore the basics of CSS's customizability in the previous week and how it is a super powerful tool to transform your website. Bootstrap 5 gave me an easier time with the use of justifying and incorporating rows and columns. However, if I had more practice with CSS I'm sure I would be able to recreate the websites made in assignments. The hardest part for me using Bootstrap 5 was just learning what the class functions did. Also, there are subclasses within it. A complex example would be something like the navbar, you can add many different features and icons and place them in a certain way just by using Bootstrap's classes. But I like it because it feels easier to implement. After all, it does it for you. If I had to implement the functions in my own CSS file it would take more than twice as long to end up with the same product.

# <conclusion\>
Overall my experience with Bootstrap was quite interesting. Being able to give your div elements attributes that can transform everything in it. I will say again that I think it works wonders for formatting with the use of rows and columns and being able to format those a certain way as well. Also having a simpler way to edit padding and margins is a good feature. I do wonder what is the process of creating UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5. To create a bunch of CSS classes into a library you have to consider all the possibles. It is very similar to learning a new programming language as its classes can be similar to Java's standard library. If that is the case then you just know how to use these class features to better your UI.

# Don't Know? Ask!
Many times in life, you will be stuck on a question or topic that you can't seem to figure out. No one has all the knowledge in the universe, many times we ought to seek help. In the context of asking computer science-based questions, there are many applications where users can get lost. From the standard terminology, using different languages with sometimes unique syntax, and just being a changing and dynamic field, new and even seasoned programmers can hit a wall. That's why it is extremely important to not only ask questions but have them well structured, so when presented can lead to a productive answer.

# Open Source Resources

The use of open forums has increased in the digital age. With sites such as Stack Overflow as of March 2022, has gained over 24 million questions on the site. With that many questions and it being a free-to-use open platform every question will not be answered. To make your posts stand out it is important to have concise information for the helpful developers online to give their time and attention to your questions.

# "Good question" - dev

A good example is when a user posted a question on how to round floating points in Javascript to two decimal places. The post was short but stated precisely what they wanted to accomplish. They included input values and the preferred outcome they wanted. With no addition of what the user's code was for or adding personal statements like their opinions, it removes all the unnecessary information. The three tags javascript, rounding, and decimal-point are all valid and essential parts of this post. Just from those tags, it allows other developers to know if they can answer this question. Lastly, evidence to back up this post is that it currently has 4152 upvotes on the site, so it can attest to how helpful to others this post is.

# How to Get Downvotes

A bad example of a question on Stack Overflow is a user posted "How much time take to learn Python." This post included the title, copied and pasted multiple times, that being all it consisted of. It appears that this post was meant to be a joke by the user. However, it remains a bad post as it is not the appropriate place to upload "jokes." A comment made on this post by user Matthais perfectly encompasses it, "If you are not even able or willing to read and follow the rules of an internet platform you use, it can take you an eternity to learn a programming language." A better place to potentially post it would be a general computer science subreddit but not an open-source platform.

# Conclusion

With hundreds of questions uploaded every day, users must remember to be productive when uploading to different forums. Just a friendly reminder to keep your questions clear and remember that developers are volunteering to help and are not required to. But more importantly, never stop questioning things because that's how learning is done. It is easy to be discouraged when facing troubles but overcoming them and persisting through is an important trait even outside of the field.
